# Path Finding Visualiser
* This tool allows for visualisations of path finding algorithms.
* Currently implemented is a*.

## Instructions for use
* The program works on a 50x50 grid.
* The first left click will select the starting point (green), the second will select the ending point (red).
* Any left clicks after this will place walls. Right clicks will delete whatever was placed in the node previously.
* If the starting/ending points are deleted, the next clicks will be the starting/ending point respectively.
* Once you wish to start the algorithm, click the _spacebar_.
